# Race to 100 Game - Implementation Plan

## Game Description
"Race to 100" is a number line game where players move from 0 to 100 by rolling dice and adding numbers, with special focus on "bridging" over tens.

### Core Mechanics
- **Addition Version**: Start at 0, roll two dice, add numbers, move toward 100
- **Subtraction Version**: Start at 100, roll dice, subtract numbers, move toward 0
- **Bridging Requirement**: When crossing a 10 (e.g., 37 + 8), player must show the bridge process (37 + 3 = 40, then +5 = 45)

## Game Features

### Visual Elements
- Number line from 0 to 100 (or 100 to 0 for subtraction)
- Player position marker
- Two dice (visual representation)
- Bridge calculation display
- Score tracking

### Gameplay Flow
1. Display current position on number line
2. Roll two dice (animated)
3. Calculate sum/difference
4. If crossing a ten, require bridging steps
5. Move player marker to new position
6. Check for win condition (reach 100 or 0)
7. Track time and moves for scoring

### Bridging Logic
When moving across a ten boundary:
- Identify the next/previous ten
- Break calculation into two steps
- Show intermediate step clearly
- Require player confirmation of understanding

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
games/raceto100/
├── index.html          # Main game file
└── script.js          # Game logic (if needed separately)
```

### Key Components
1. **Number Line Visualization** - Interactive visual representation
2. **Dice Rolling System** - Animated dice with random results
3. **Bridge Calculator** - Step-by-step breakdown display
4. **Position Tracker** - Player movement on number line
5. **Game State Manager** - Current position, mode (add/subtract), score
6. **Win Condition Handler** - End game when target reached

### Integration with Existing System
- Add to main index.html navigation
- Follow existing styling patterns from other games
- Integrate with ScoreManager system for high scores
- Use similar HTML structure and CSS classes

## Score System
- **Time-based scoring**: Faster completion = higher score
- **Move efficiency**: Fewer rolls to complete = bonus points
- **Accuracy bonus**: Correct bridging calculations = extra points

## Variations to Implement
1. **Classic Addition**: 0 → 100
2. **Subtraction Reverse**: 100 → 0
3. **Difficulty modes**: Different target numbers (50, 75, 150)
4. **Educational mode**: Step-by-step bridging required
5. **Speed mode**: Time pressure for quick mental math

## Testing Plan
- Verify dice rolling randomness
- Test bridging calculation accuracy
- Validate win conditions
- Check integration with main navigation
- Test scoring system functionality
